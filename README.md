# Reddit-Player-One
A open source VR Game.

# Overview
This is a design document for this open source VR game.

# Elevator Pitch
This game is inpired by Ready player one and will take place in a low poly world where participants can play mini-games to collect coins,
they can socialise and challenge each other in mini-games where their coins are on the line.

# Executive Summary
High Concept: Open source simplifed ready player one.  
Game Genre: MMO/Mini-games.  
Setting: Low poly environment.  
Target Player: VR users.  
Play Value: Collecting coins and socialising in VR.  
What’s Unique: open source VR game and varying styles of mini-games  
Game Engine: Unity  
Networking: Normcore.io

# Ideal Play Session
Joe puts his VR headset on his head and is ready to play a free and open source game that he saw on Reddit. When the game loads and ask him to enter his name he can already hear other players talking in the background. Once he has entered his name he is fully inside the game.

In front of him there is a billboard that spells out "Welcome to .... " and instructions of what he can do.
He also sees a leaderboard high in the sky with the names of the 10 players with most coins.

# Procedures

Goals  
The main goal is to have the most coins and be featured on the leaderboard?

Set-Up  
List all of the steps required to set up the game before players actually start playing (e.g., level generation, enemy placement, resource allocation).

Special Situations  
List any special modes or situations that are not the normal part of progress (such as landing in jail in the game Monopoly)

Invasion = Aliens/Other Enemies begin to attack, all players recieve a temporary special gun in front of them and need to collaboratively destroy aliens for a period of 2 minutes. Coins are awarded for kills and enemies shoot lasers that take players coins when a player is hit.

Resolution  
There is no end to the game

# Mechanics
List each of the mechanics the player can perform in your game (move, maneuver, jump, combat, aim, shoot, collect, buy, build, destroy, etc.)

For each mechanic describe:

Action: The action the player performs.  
Purpose: The reason why the player performs it.  
System: What game system is this action considered a part of? (e.g., movement, exploration, combat, economy, inventory, magic.)  
Challenge: What makes performing the action difficult?  
Trigger: What events or situations makes the action necessary.  
Cue: What, if anything, lets players know that it is a good time to perform the action..  
Requirements: What resources and/or procedures are required to perform the action perform the action..  
Limitations: What rules place limits on the action’s frequency or effect? (e.g., cool down period).  
Feedback: What, if anything lets players know they performed the action successfully?  
Reward: What does the player receive or accomplish for performing the action. (e.g., resources).    

Walking:
Joystick? Swing arms? Teleport?  
Walking should have a smooth locomotion on the left thumbstick and when clicked in a teleport is activated.

Enter Mini game:
How?
Portals

Open Inventory:
To store and take items in a limited bag similar to the inventory in TWD Saints and Sinners
This can be linked to all areas for example store weapons for combat
This should be an important accesible system so the easier the better
On a button press eg A button on Oculus touch, the bag shows up in front of the player
You should be able to upgrade the bag with additional resources to increase capacity and change its look 

# Resources

For each resource describe:  

Resource: What the resource is..  
Purpose: What is the resource used for in the game.  
System(s): What game system(s) is this resource considered a part of? (e.g., movement, exploration, combat, economy, inventory, magic.)  
Production: How is the resource produced?  
Consumption: How is the resource consumed?  
Ownership: Who can own the resource? How does resource ownership change  
Storage: Can the resource be stored? If so, how?  

Coins are the only resource? 

# Elements  
For each game element ( obstacles, deadly traps, units, enemies, bosses, tools, power-ups, pick-ups, power-ups, controllers, chargers, etc.) describe:  

Purpose: What purpose does the element perform in the game? How does it help or hinder the players from achieving their goals?  
System(s): What game system(s) is this resource considered a part of? (e.g., movement, exploration, combat, economy, inventory, magic.)  
Production: When and where does it appear in the game?  
Consumption: When and how is it removed from the game?  
Attributes: The numbers describing the element’s capabilities (e.g., speed, hit points, damage, area of effect, sensing area). If an element has multiple attributes, construct a table. (At this time, you may not know specific information for such factors as starting character health, weapon damage, terrain movement penalties and the like, so feel free to use relative values such as Low, Medium, and High. It’s also okay just to pick a number as a starting point.)  
Behaviors: The actions that perform. Describe what triggers the action and the effect of that action. If the element has different states that determine what actions can perform, draw a state diagram.


# Systems
What are the systems in your game that determine what actions players can perform, how resources are produced and consumed, and how game objects behave?

Examples of game systems:  

Life (health, healing/regeneration, death, lives)  
Progression (experience, levels, leveling-up)   
Combat (weapons, defenses, ammo, initiative, damage/health, power-ups, fumbles, critical hits)  
AI (spawning, stealth/surprise, pursuit, attack, retreat, surrender)  
Economy (currency, resources, income, expenses, conversion)  
Inventory (items, purchasing, selling, trading, storage, equipping)  
Magic (mana, regeneration, spell acquisition, spell use, effects)  
For each system, describe:  

System: The name of the system.  
Purpose: The purpose of that system in the game.  
Actions: Player actions that are part of that system.  
Elements: Game elements that are part of that system.  
Resources Consumed: Resources consumed by that system.  
Resources Produced: Resources produced by that system.  
Draw a system diagram, showing how the systems are connected by what resources are consumed and produced by each system.  

# User Interface  
Create a UI Flowchart consisting of all the screens in your game and how they flow from one to another. Past this chart at the top of this page.  

Paste in wireframes for each of your game screens, such as:  

Main Menu  
Help  
Settings  
Main Game Screen (including HUD)  
Win Screen  
Lose Screen  
Label all elements of your wireframes so the reader understands what each button, icon and indicator is.
